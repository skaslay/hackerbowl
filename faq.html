                <strong>What is the Hacker Bowl?</strong>
                  <p>The Hacker Bowl is a statewide hackathon, presented by BCS Startup and AskU, designed to promote and inspire competition among the region’s best hackers. The Hacker Bowl, hosted in College Station, TX will serve as a battleground for hackers representing themselves and their Universities, as teams will be traveling from across the state to compete in web and mobile application design. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The Hacker Bowl grew from AggieHack, a student run hackathon at Texas A&M which had more than 100 Aggie students participate in last year’s inaugural event. The upcoming event, expanded to include greater Texas, will be a two-day event beginning March 1st, with special presentations throughout. We are expecting at least 300-500 students from the state’s most prominent universities, competing for a grand prize. In particular, UT, Rice, Houston, Baylor, and Texas A&M are some of schools that will be present. </p>
                <strong>Who can participate?</strong>
                  <p>Any and all who consider them hackers within the state of Texas</p>
                <strong>What if I'm a newbie?</strong>
                  <p>Come anyway! We highly encourage you to team up with more experienced Hackers to help you learn. Also, there will also be awesome mentors at the event to introduce you to cool new technologies, and help you with your Hack. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The Hacker Bowl isn’t just a competition it’s an experience. You’ll be able to hangout with and learn from some of the best Hackers in the world, and spend 24 hours immersed in the most innovative technology on the planet. And if worst comes to worst, you still get free food. </p>
                <strong>Do I have to be a Texas A&M student?</strong>
                  <p>Absolutely Not! This event is for any college student in the state of Texas that is, or aspires to be a Hacker.</p>
                <strong>What should I bring?</strong>
                  <p>Bring any and all tools you need to build your Hack. If you need any special accommodations for your equipment, just let us know.</p>
                <strong>Do I need a team or idea to sign up?</strong>
                  <p>It is highly encouraged that you find a team of four Hackers from your school to compete with. However, if you are unable to do so we’ll be able to place you on another team at the start of the competition.
                  <br/><br/>
                  You should definitely discuss ideas with your team before the event. The earlier you start planning, the cooler the Hack will be!</p>
                <strong>Do I have to be there the entire time?</strong>
                  <p>In order to compete in the competition you must stay for the entire Hackathon. You’re allowed to arrive to the competition late, but all code for your project must be written on site.</p>
                <strong>How does registration work?</strong>
                  <p></p>
                <strong>Where should I go during the event?</strong>
                  <p>The entire event will take place at Reed Arena on the Texas A&M campus.</p>
                <strong>Will there be food?</strong>
                  <p>Yes! Every meal will be provided during the hackathon, and a plethora of snacks will always be accessible. Just let us know in advance if you have any special dietary concerns, and we’ll gladly accommodate. So don’t worry about food, focus on hacking and we’ll make sure you’re well fed.
                  </p>
                <strong>What are the sleeping/showering arrangments?</strong>
                  <p></p>
                <strong>Can I start working before the Hacker Bowl starts?</strong>
                  <p>Teams are not allowed to use code they have written prior to the competition in their project. However, certain circumstances exceptions can be made if the software/hardware doesn’t present a competitive advantage for the team. If you have any doubt whether or not your project will be allowed just let us know and we’ll see what we can do. We don’t want this rule to stop you from building something amazing!  
                  </p>
                <strong>When are project submissions due?</strong>
                  <p>Laptops close at exactly 1pm on the second day of the competition (March 2).</p>
                <strong>How does judging work?</strong>
                  <p>We are working to construct a judging panel that consists of Hackers and Designers from industry and academia. Learn more about the individual judges as we get closer to the event!
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Based on a the judges criteria teams will be awarded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. Additionally, teams will be recognized for a variety of “Best” prizes, such as “Best Design”. The winners in these categories receive small (but still awesome) prizes.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The Hacker Bowl  will be awarded to the school with the best overall showing in the competition, and declared the “Best Hacker College in Texas”! The criteria for the Hacker Bowl will factor in things such as school size, to even the playing field for smaller schools. </p>
                <strong>When are demos?</strong>
                  <p>TDemos will begin after the keynote on Sunday. Teams should be ready to present their projects at exactly 2pm.</p>
                <strong>Do you provide us with any technology?</strong>
                  <p>We want to help you build something awesome. We will provide you with all the essentials (power and internet), but you must bring your own tools to hack. This includes computers, monitors, etc. If your Hack requires some sort of crazy hardware, then bring it! Just be sure to let us know in advance.
                  </p>
